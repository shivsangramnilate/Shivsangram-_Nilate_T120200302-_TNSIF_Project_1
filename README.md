# Heart Disease Regression App

❤️ Heart Disease Regression App

A machine-learning–based application that predicts the risk or severity of heart disease using regression techniques. The project analyzes key medical features—such as age, cholesterol level, and blood pressure—to generate a quantitative heart-risk score.

🔍 Project Overview

Uses ML regression models to estimate heart-disease risk.

Performs data preprocessing, feature selection, and normalization for accurate predictions.

A trained model (iteration1_model.pkl) is integrated into a Streamlit web application for easy user interaction.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Streamlit
